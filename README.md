## Overview

Users should be able to:

- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Material UI
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

The beauty of the lightweight state management library - Zustand. I enjoyed building this out by myself. I also learned about keeping CSS files organized, this is will help me when I go back to using Tailwind to style my components.

P.S. When styling MaterialUI components READ THE API!!! Thank me later.

### Continued development

After completing an advanced challenge by yourself, there is also one place to go next.
